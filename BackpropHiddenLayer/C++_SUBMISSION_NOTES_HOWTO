For the C++ Submission, need:

1. Training set accuracy (re-feed training data, check accuracy)
2. Test set accuracy (feed a test-specific dataset, check accuracy)
3. Mystery set accuracy (feed a second, test-specific dataset, check accuracy)

*. Wait to receive mystery data set
**. Accuracy = (Number of hits) / (Total evaluations)
***. A hit is when the strongest signal matches the classifier

-> Generalization trade-off, more bias, less variance and vice versa
--> This applies when the net is over-trained on the training set
        Performs worse on the test set.
